## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues with Browser MCP, try the following steps:

### Extension Issues

- **Reload the extension**:  
  Go to `chrome://extensions/`, turn the extension off and on, or click **Reload**.
- **Remove and re-add**:  
  If reloading doesnâ€™t work, remove the extension and install it again.
- **Reconnect**:  
  Disconnect from your MCP client and connect again to refresh the session.

### Server Issues

- **Check running process**:  
  The server typically runs on port `3000`. If itâ€™s already in use, the server may fail to start.
- **Kill the process**:  
  Find and stop the process running on port `3000`.

On Linux/macOS:

```bash
  lsof -i :3000
  kill -9 <PID>
```

On Windows:

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

After restarting the server and extension, try running your automation commands again.
