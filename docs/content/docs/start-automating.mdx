# Start automating

Now that you have MCPX set up, let's start automating your browser with AI applications.

## Basic Commands

### Opening Pages

```
Open google.com
Navigate to https://example.com
Go to the GitHub homepage
```

### Clicking Elements

```
Click the search button
Click on the link that says "Sign up"
Click the submit button
```

### Typing Text

```
Type "hello world" in the search box
Enter my email address in the email field
Fill out the form with my details
```

### Data Extraction

```
Get the page title
Extract all links from this page
Take a screenshot of the current page
Get the text content from the main article
```

## Example Workflows

### Web Search Automation

```
1. Open google.com
2. Type "MCPX browser automation" in the search box
3. Click the search button
4. Take a screenshot of the results
5. Extract the titles of the first 5 results
```

### Form Filling

```
1. Navigate to https://example.com/contact
2. Fill in the name field with "John Doe"
3. Enter "john@example.com" in the email field
4. Type "Hello, this is a test message" in the message field
5. Click the submit button
```

### E-commerce Automation

```
1. Go to an online store
2. Search for "laptop"
3. Click on the first product
4. Extract the product name and price
5. Add the item to cart
6. Take a screenshot of the cart
```

## AI Integration Examples

### With Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpx": {
      "command": "mcpx-server",
      "args": ["--port", "3000"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then in Claude:

```
Please open reddit.com and find the top 3 posts from r/programming today
```

### With Custom MCP Clients

```python
import mcp_client

client = mcp_client.connect("http://localhost:3000")

# Open a webpage
client.navigate("https://news.ycombinator.com")

# Extract headlines
headlines = client.extract_text("h1, h2, h3")

# Take screenshot
screenshot = client.screenshot()
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with basic navigation and clicking before attempting complex workflows.

### 2. Use Descriptive Commands

Instead of:

```
Click button
```

Use:

```
Click the blue "Submit" button at the bottom of the form
```

### 3. Handle Timing

Some pages need time to load:

```
Open example.com
Wait for the page to load completely
Then click the menu button
```

### 4. Error Handling

Plan for common issues:

```
Try to click the login button
If that fails, look for a "Sign In" link instead
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

```
If there's a cookie banner, click "Accept"
Otherwise, proceed to the main navigation
```

### Multiple Tabs

```
Open example.com in a new tab
Switch to the first tab
Compare content between tabs
```

### Data Processing

```
Extract all product prices from this page
Calculate the average price
Save the results to a file
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Enable Debug Mode

Set the extension to debug mode to see detailed logs of all actions.

### Check Server Logs

Monitor the MCP server console for error messages and performance data.

### Use Browser Dev Tools

The browser's developer tools can help identify element selectors and page structure.
