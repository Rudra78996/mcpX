## Prerequisites

### Node.js

You need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher) installed to use the Browser MCPX server.  
Node.js comes bundled with **npm**, which is also required.

Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Add MCP server

Add the MCP server configuration to an AI application that supports MCP.

**Example applications that support MCP:**

- Cursor
- Claude Desktop
- Windsurf
- VS Code

## Each application requires adding the mcpX configuration in its MCP settings.

## Cursor Server config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-mcpx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@rpx_/mcpx@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Next step

Continue with [**Set up extension**](/docs/setup-extension) to connect the MCP server to your browser.
