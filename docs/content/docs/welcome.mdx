## Introduction

Welcome to **Browser MCPX** — an MCP server designed to automate your browser and extend the power of AI applications.

## What is MCP?

The [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that enables AI applications to interact with external tools and services in a structured, consistent way.

With MCP, language models can seamlessly access context, trigger actions, and integrate with different systems — all without being locked to a single vendor or platform.
