# Troubleshooting

- **Extension not connected**: Check `http://localhost:3000/ws-status`. Restart the bridge and reload the extension.
- **Port in use**: Change the bridge port in your start command and update any hardcoded URLs.
- **Command not found**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed and on PATH.
- **Client cannot find tools**: Confirm your client config points to the correct command and that the server is running.
- **Windows quoting**: When using `node -e` inline commands, escape quotes appropriately or run from a small script.
